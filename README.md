**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// WebSocket connection (persistent)
const socket = io('http://localhost:5000');

// Listen for messages from server
socket.on('new_message', (data) => {
    addChatMessage(data);
});

// Send message to server (broadcasts to all)
socket.emit('send_message', { message: 'Hello!' });
```

**The Magic Moment:**  
Opened two browser windows, sent message in one window ‚Üí appeared INSTANTLY in the other window with ZERO refresh. This is how Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp Web work.

**Architecture:**
```
