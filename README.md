```
task_manager_capstone/
├── task.py                 # Base Task class
├── task_types.py           # WorkTask, PersonalTask, ShoppingTask
├── weather_service.py      # API integration layer
├── file_handler.py         # Data persistence layer
├── task_manager.py         # Business logic
├── main.py                 # UI and application flow
└── __init__.py             # Package initialization
```

**Technical Implementation Highlights:**

**1. Object-Oriented Design:**
```python
# Base class
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title, description, priority):
        self.title = title
        self.completed = False

# Inheritance for specialized tasks
class WorkTask(Task):
    def __init__(self, title, description, priority, project):
        super().__init__(title, description, priority)
        self.project = project
        self.category = "Work"
```

**2. API Integration:**
```python
class WeatherService:
    def get_weather(self, city):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/{city}?format=j1"
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
        return self._parse_weather_data(response.json())
```

**3. Data Persistence:**
```python
class FileHandler:
    def save_tasks(self, tasks):
        data = [task.to_dict() for task in tasks]
        with open(self.filename, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(data, f, indent=4)
```

**4. Professional UX:**
```python
def clear_screen():
    """Cross-platform screen clearing"""
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
```

**Key Achievements:**
- Built first **multi-module application** (7 files)
- Implemented **complete OOP hierarchy** (base class + 3 specialized classes)
- Integrated **external API** into larger system
- Created **business logic layer** for task management
- Implemented **data persistence** that actually works
- Added **professional CLI experience** with screen clearing
- **Fixed UX issues** independently (screen clearing bug)
- **All features work flawlessly** - tested with screenshots

**The Reality:**
This is a **production-ready application**. Not a tutorial project. Not a broken demo. A **working system** that:
- Manages tasks effectively
- Integrates real-time weather
- Persists data between sessions
- Provides analytics
- Has professional architecture
- Works cross-platform

**What This Proves:**
```
Day 1:  "What's a variable?"
Day 14: "Built a 7-file production application with OOP, APIs, and data persistence"
```
